            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Welcome a new blog</h1>
<p>For a long time I believed that having a blog would just create an account in some system such as Blogger, Tumblr, Wordpress, or LiveJournal and quit writing, over the years I realized that doing this is simple and easy and if this is your goal, but I wanted something more, wanted to share my knowledge in a place where I had full control and freedom, and they can run Python course also wanted something that I pudessse migrate easily and simply, without the database, uncomplicated to build the environment and that allow me to create content offline with versioning.
Thinking about it I decided to migrate my blog from Tumblr (<a class="reference external" href="http://mr-marcelo-barbosa.tumblr.com">http://mr-marcelo-barbosa.tumblr.com/</a>) to GitHub Pages using Tinkerer (<a class="reference external" href="http://tinkerer.me">http://tinkerer.me/</a>) using Sphinx (http :/ / sphinx.pocoo.org /) to generate your blog, as I use for my personal wiki shpinx was a simple choice for me.
In coming posts I will talk about this change and who want to keep up my old posts in the Portuguese Brazil: <a class="reference external" href="http://mr-marcelo-barbosa.tumblr.com">http://mr-marcelo-barbosa.tumblr.com/</a></p>
