Welcome a new blog
==================

For a long time I believed that having a blog would just create an account in some system such as `Blogger <https://www.blogger.com>`_, `Tumblr <https://www.tumblr.com>`_, `Wordpress <http://wordpress.org>`_, or `LiveJournal <http://www.livejournal.com>`_ and quit writing, over the years I realized that doing this is simple and easy and if this is your goal, but I wanted something more, wanted to share my knowledge in a place where I had full control and freedom, and they can run `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ course also wanted something that I migrate easily and simply, without the database, uncomplicated to build the environment and that allow me to create content offline with versioning.
Thinking about it I decided to migrate `my blog from Tumblr <http://mr-marcelo-barbosa.tumblr.com>`_ to `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com>`_ using: 
 - `Tinkerer <http://tinkerer.me>`_ with: 
 - `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_ 

to generate your blog, as I use for my personal wiki shpinx was a simple choice for me.
In coming posts I will talk about this change and who want to keep up my old posts in the Portuguese Brazil:
