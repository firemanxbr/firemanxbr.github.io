Welcome a new blog
==================

For a long time I believed that having a blog would just create an account in some system such as Blogger, Tumblr, Wordpress, or LiveJournal and quit writing, over the years I realized that doing this is simple and easy and if this is your goal, but I wanted something more, wanted to share my knowledge in a place where I had full control and freedom, and they can run Python course also wanted something that I pudessse migrate easily and simply, without the database, uncomplicated to build the environment and that allow me to create content offline with versioning.
Thinking about it I decided to migrate my blog from Tumblr (http://mr-marcelo-barbosa.tumblr.com/) to GitHub Pages using: 
 - Tinkerer (http://tinkerer.me/) with: 
 - Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) 

to generate your blog, as I use for my personal wiki shpinx was a simple choice for me.
In coming posts I will talk about this change and who want to keep up my old posts in the Portuguese Brazil:
