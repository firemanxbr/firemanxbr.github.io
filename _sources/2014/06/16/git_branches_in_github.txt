Creating git branches in GitHub
===============================

I was migrate this blog of `Tumblr <https://www.tumblr.com>`_ to `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com>`_ and have some problem: Where search this procedures ? 
Searching about this I think: Why no share with all ?

**TIP:** For example, I created one new version for my app and I no versioned this source, but I finish this new version I wish send to GitHub, but with new branch:

I have initialize versioning in my source::
 $ git init 

Create my new branch, only local in this moment::
$ git checkout -b name-new-branch

Add my sources in this initial version::
$ git add .

After I have commit this initial version::
$ git commit -m "Initial version of branch 'name-new-branch' "

And sent to GitHub(create new branch and push this initial version)::
$ git push URL-YOUR-PROJECT-GITHUB.git name-new-branch

I go create more tips in new posts...
