Creating git branches in GitHub
===============================

When I migrated this blog from `Tumblr <https://www.tumblr.com>`_ to `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com>`_ I had to sort out some issues. While searching about how to have them sorted out I thought: why not share this knowledge with other folks?

**TIP:** I created a new version of my application, but I have not had it versioned before:

I have initialize versioning in my source::

        $ git init 


Create my new branch, only local in this moment::

        $ git checkout -b name-new-branch


Add my sources in this initial version::

        $ git add .


After I have commit this initial version::

        $ git commit -m "Initial version of branch 'name-new-branch' "


And sent to GitHub(create new branch and push this initial version)::

        $ git push URL-YOUR-PROJECT-GITHUB.git name-new-branch


I go create more tips in new posts...
